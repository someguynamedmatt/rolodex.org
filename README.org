This package provides a way to easily reference contacts in various org files. Each person/contact can be
represented as an alias link (e.g. ~@matt~), which links to a rolodex file. Each heading in the rolodex file
represents a known contact, and each /reference/ to that contact is linked within that contact's heading in
the rolodex file.

For instance: by invoking the package via a key-mapping (I use ~C-@~), I get a listing of "known" contacts
in my rolodex...

If the name doesn't yet exist in my rolodex I'll be prompted to input the contact's name and an alias, which
will be used in the links...

After I link the contact a reference (another link) will be placed within that contact's heading in the
rolodex file...
